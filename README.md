# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects. 

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

I use this to practice my frontend skills as well as to add more projects to my portfolio.
I will use Canva to get the exact color code since i havent paid for the codewell pro.

I will posting here so that incase you are doing the same challenge you will have the ease to know what color code to use to get the replica of that design. Thank you.
